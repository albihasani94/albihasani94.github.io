# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `feature/[short-slug]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

> All content additions MUST include valid YAML front matter, use two-space indentation for HTML/Markdown fragments, and note any navigation or include updates required.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value (e.g., a new article,
  refactored include, or refreshed asset).
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Previewed via `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` and linked from home page"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when navigation/front matter is missing or mis-ordered?
- How does the site handle absent images, broken permalinks, or missing SEO metadata?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Site MUST [specific capability, e.g., "publish a new article at `/posts/.../`"]
- **FR-002**: Site MUST [specific capability, e.g., "surface navigation to the new page"]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "access the updated content on mobile and desktop"]
- **FR-004**: Site MUST [data requirement, e.g., "populate SEO metadata and social card previews"]
- **FR-005**: Build MUST pass (`bundle exec jekyll build`) with zero warnings related to this feature

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: Site MUST surface contact/CTA flows via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: email link, form provider, etc.]
- **FR-007**: Site MUST retain analytics or form submissions for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Updated page renders without layout issues across target breakpoints"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "`bundle exec jekyll build` completes with 0 warnings"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "Bounce rate for updated page decreases by N%"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Highlight drives â‰¥ X clicks to the targeted CTA"]
