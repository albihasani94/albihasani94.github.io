You go there you program your way around a project and at some point the product is shipped or the client gives up on the product, and you stop working on it.

That's the point where you stop the arcade game.

The next time you build a new project, you're reset to the point zero in the arcade game. There's a new theme but you have to defeat the same bosses. After doing this repeatedly enough, you get a brain memory for the problems you have to solve and the approach you take around them. You've gotten good at the game. Other arcade players even ask you when they're stuck in their games. You keep playing the arcade and you win at it so often.

There lies an unspoken danger of getting complacent and losing interest in the game. That may come in the form of feeling like you're not doing everything new, and you need a new game. You even sabotage your own arcade game because you're bored and you may lose skills as you go doing the same thing over and over. The new players can discover ways to beat the game faster without as much damage.

As you keep inserting coins of your work, and never going past a final boss that you have defeated in a previous game, you begin to think as if you don't like the game anymore. You continuosly need a new mission to beat.

If you're lucky enough, the arcade master will always push new levels to the game you keep playing, and you may feel like there is no need to change the game at all. You stay pretty solid at your game and while the new levels keep coming you feel entertained and motivated to play. That's sometimes the case, but there might also be normal for the arcade masters to always have new players coming in their arcade to play, their arcade room is so full, that they don't need to care much about adding new levels to the game or changing anything, so what looks like winning formula for newcomers, it gets boring for the arcade players who have stayed in the game for so long.

## How to keep the same ol' game enjoyable

It may seem like you can't play the same game in the same environment again and again, but you can change the environment you keep playing. The variables that you can change are many.

You can find a better crowd to push you to success or boo you as you play like you can find a different motivator actor in programming, this can be a different client you are working for or another witness to your work.

You can find a different player for your team and you will experience the game differently in a similar manner to as you change teams in programming.

You can open a window in the arcade room and you can see what's behind that as you can have a window to the real world aspects of your work. You begin to see the impact of your work and that is there even after you stop working.

The companies programmers work for are often mistaked for the arcade masters (how bad that sounds these days). They indeed have such an influence on how programmers can have a better environment to play, being that physical support, say a better chair and monitor, and moral support, applauding successes and accepting failures.

At the end of the day, you're much more responsible for how you decide to do your game and even impact the arcade room while you're there to play. In a way, you are the only arcade master for the time you keep inserting coins.

You realize that when you're working on your own. You begin to understand that you are the one who has to applaud your successes and accept your failures. After 9-5, you're always the arcade master and how you setup your environment and prepare your mental approach, it will pay off in your success in the arcade game and the world beyond the window.
