Java will have records, and it will have them soon! Yayy! Now, what does that mean and how on earth did we need these?

## Person Begins

## The Dark Pair

## The Record Rises

> Enhance the Java programming language with records. Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes which are transparent holders for shallowly immutable data.

You could think of them as data stores. You want to store data, and you want it now. Records are for you then.

By writing records, you immediately take care of the need for the likes of constructors, getters and setters, equals(),and hashCode().

## To Sum Up

Dear reader, please don’t be this guy.

This guy thinks Java is stuck and Java is dead and we should have forsaken it a long long time ago.

The premises are that, Java is going to evolve. It has had a huge usage share over the years, and that itself can explain the Java stagnation. From Java 8 with Streams and Optionals, to further improvements in Java 9, and oh my gosh Modules!, to var in Java 10, and everything new I cannot cover in one long sentence, people will gradually come into terms with the fact that they like or not, Java has come a long way and it’s moving fast.

Yeah, C# had it first, Kotlin is in the future. Yes. If you want to use C#, use C#. If you want to use Kotlin, use Kotlin. Just because something works for you and your team doesn’t mean something else won’t work for someone else.

That’s the joy of programming. There is not a single way to do a single thing. The possibilities are endless. That’s why I enjoy working in this field and being part of the community. Happy new year!
