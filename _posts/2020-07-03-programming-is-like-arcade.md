You go there you program your way around a project and at some point, the product is shipped or the client gives up on the product, and you stop working on it.

<!--more-->

That's the point where you stop the arcade game.

The next time you build a new project, you're reset to the point zero in the arcade game. There's a new theme but you have to defeat the same bosses. You will find that not much has changed beneath the surface. You navigate the same setups mostly and solve the same problem under a different name.

After doing this repeatedly enough, you get a brain memory for the problems you have to solve and the approach you take to beat them. You've gotten good at the game. Other arcade players even ask you when they're stuck in their games. You keep playing the arcade and you win at it so often.

There lies an unspoken danger of getting complacent and losing interest in the game. That may come in the form of feeling like you're not doing everything new, and you need a new game. You even sabotage your own arcade game because you're bored and you may lose skills as you go doing the same thing over and over. The new players can discover ways to beat the game faster without as much damage.

As you keep inserting coins of your work, and never getting past a final boss that you have defeated in the past, you begin to think as if you don't like the game anymore. You continuously need a new mission to beat.

If you're lucky enough, the arcade masters will push new levels forever to the game you keep playing, and you may feel like there is no need to change the game at all. You stay pretty solid at your game and while the new levels keep coming you feel entertained and motivated to play. That's sometimes the case, but there might also be normal for the arcade masters to get lazy like the game room owners who always have their arcade room full, have new players coming in their arcade to play, that they don't need to care much about adding new levels to the game or changing any formula. 

What looks like a winning formula for them, it is a shortcut to eventual boredom.

## How to keep the same ol' game enjoyable

It may seem like you can't play the same game in the same environment again and again, but you can change the environment you play. The variables that you can change are many.

You can find a better crowd to push you to success or boo you as you play like you can find a different motivator actor in programming, this can be a different client you are working for or another witness to your work.

You can find a different player for your team and you will experience the game differently as you do when you change teams while you keep programming.

You can open a window in the arcade room and you can see what's behind that in the same way you can have a window to the real world aspects of your work. You begin to see the impact of your work and that is there even after you stop working.

You try to do something different, you hold your breath when you encounter a new boss, and you let the arcade masters know that the latest challenge is worth it, as it keeps you at the edge of your seat. 

You alternate the times when you choose to play, but at the end you expect an intervention from the system owner, you keep waiting for the arcade masters to tailor the game better for you and fix it all in a button.

## Getting to meet the arcade masters

Who are them?

From the outside, it seems like your employer is the arcade master. It's a very thin line: they indeed have such an influence on how programmers can have a better environment to play, being that physical support, say a better chair and monitor, and moral support, applauding successes and accepting failures. They choose the projects like an arcade owner feeding games for the players. They so often make the ground rules, and it seems like you can never escape the system.

But, that is an illusion. You are the sole captain of your arcade game.

At the end of the day, you learn that you are much more responsible for how you decide to do your game and even impact the arcade room while you're there to play. In a way, you are the only arcade master for the time you keep inserting coins.

You realize that when you're working on your own for some time. You begin to understand that you are the one who has to applaud your successes and accept your failures. After 9-5, you've always been the arcade master.

How you set up your environment and prepare your mental approach, it will pay off in your success in the arcade game and the world beyond the window.

You get to choose to make the arcade game enjoyable again, making new friends and beating colorful monsters as you're in search of new problems and new ways, the same way you played arcade that time you were young.

## The dangers of being the arcade master

After you cross the line assumed, that the arcade master is some foreign entity, you realize that you are most accountable for the walls around your game, but that is not all to it.

You have to put your plan and limitations. It's true that if you are employed, your employer will usually have a hand in these, say the arcade opening hours, the time you play for a day, closing the arcade on weekends. Still, these are only physical constraints. Within these physical constraints, are free to simulate your own arcade game.

Doing so, you become free of structure and a plan from outside, this is buying your own arcade at home. When you wake up the next day and you have your game at home, you have to plan wisely. You don't have that much incentive to play, because it no longer is that hard to go out there and play. The arcade is open to you 24/7.

With great power comes great responsibility.

You have to keep investing in the arcade game. You decide the hours that you are playing, the coins you put in are yours at the end of the day, and you have to decide what time percentage you're going to program new game levels, and what time percentage you're gonna have to play with them. Finding that share is like beating the most clever boss in the arcade of programming.

*Seriously, this is not 100% true. Programming is not an arcade, it has far more serious social and economical impact that you simply don't match in an arcade room. I was just bored so I wrote this.*
