# Contracts: Update Social Branding to X

No external APIs or service contracts are introduced or modified for this feature. All work occurs within static site templates and assets.

Verification relies on:
- Visual inspection of `_includes/social.html` rendering
- Accessibility tooling (e.g., Lighthouse, screen reader checks)
- Analytics dashboards confirming referral attribution from `https://x.com/`
