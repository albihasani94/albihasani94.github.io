# Tasks: Update Social Branding to X

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-x-brand-update/`  
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (user stories), research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

**Tests**: Run `bundle exec jekyll build` for every story. Add browser or Lighthouse checks only if requested.  
**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each slice can be previewed independently.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: User story identifier (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Reference exact file paths (e.g., `_includes/social.html`)

## Path Conventions
- Content: `_posts/`, `_drafts/`, `index.markdown`, `about.markdown`
- Presentation: `_includes/`, `_sass/`, `assets/` (images, CSS)
- Configuration: `_config.yml`, `Gemfile`, `CNAME`
- Temporary build output (`_site/`) and Bundler artifacts (`vendor/`) stay uncommitted

<!--
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: Replace the sample tasks below with real tasks derived from:
  - User stories and requirements in spec.md
  - Principles in the constitution (build verification, Markdown discipline, template sync)
  - Navigation, SEO, and asset considerations documented in plan.md

  Tasks MUST stay grouped by user story so each story ships independently and
  can be previewed via `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts`.
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 1: Foundation Checks (Blocking)

**Purpose**: Ensure the repository has the official X asset and documented provenance before template work begins.

- [X] T001 Create `assets/custom_icons/` directory and add tracking file `assets/custom_icons/.gitkeep`.
- [X] T002 Download the official X SVG logo from the brand kit into `assets/custom_icons/x.svg` and record the source URL in `assets/custom_icons/README.md`.
- [X] T003 Optimize `assets/custom_icons/x.svg` with `svgo --multipass`, confirm the file size is ‚â§ 10 KB, and document the size and checksum in `assets/custom_icons/README.md`.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Align global configuration with the new social presence before user story work.

- [X] T004 Update `_config.yml` social configuration to expose `site.x_username` pointing to `https://x.com/albihasani94` and remove active references to `site.twitter_username`.
- [X] T005 Run `bundle exec jekyll build` from project root `./` to confirm the site builds cleanly with the new asset and configuration baseline.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Follow the X Profile (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Visitors can click the social icon and reach the X profile with accessible labeling.

**Independent Test**: `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` ‚Üí footer social link renders X icon, opens `https://x.com/albihasani94` in new tab, and is announced as ‚ÄúX‚Äù by screen readers.

### Implementation

- [X] T006 [US1] Replace the Twitter entry in `_includes/social.html` with an X link that loads `/assets/custom_icons/x.svg`, points to `https://x.com/albihasani94`, and sets `aria-label="Follow Albi on X"`.
- [X] T007 [US1] Ensure the X list item in `_includes/social.html` opens in a new tab with `target="_blank"` and `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, and the visible label displays ‚ÄúX‚Äù.
- [X] T008 [US1] Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` in project root `./` and validate icon rendering, link destination, and screen-reader announcement for the X social link.

**Checkpoint**: US1 content live-ready; build passes locally with zero warnings.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Maintain Brand Consistency (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: All non-legacy references align with the X brand while other social links remain unchanged.

**Independent Test**: Repository-wide search (excluding `_posts/`, `_drafts/`) yields no active ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äù references, and social UI still renders uniformly.

- [X] T009 [US2] Update `_config.yml` metadata (e.g., SEO or social link labels) to say ‚ÄúX‚Äù where the social link is surfaced, removing ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äù text outside historical content.
- [X] T010 [US2] Replace remaining non-legacy ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äù mentions by auditing repository root `./` (excluding `_posts/`, `_drafts/`) and document any intentional exceptions in `specs/001-x-brand-update/research.md`.
- [X] T011 [US2] Re-run `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts` in project root `./` and verify layout, spacing, and styling for all social icons remain consistent after copy updates.

**Checkpoint**: US2 renders independently and is linkable without US1 dependencies.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Track Referral Traffic (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Analytics guidance ensures referral traffic continues to attribute to X without reconfiguration.

**Independent Test**: Documentation details expected referral names and manual validation steps sourced in analytics tooling.

- [X] T012 [US3] Expand the analytics guidance in `specs/001-x-brand-update/quickstart.md` to include explicit steps for validating X referral attribution post-deploy.
- [X] T013 [US3] Record the expected analytics referrer label (‚Äúx.com‚Äù or provider-specific equivalent) and validation notes in `specs/001-x-brand-update/research.md`.

**Checkpoint**: US3 documentation enables attribution checks without additional implementation dependencies.

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [X] T014 Document the official X asset source and optimization steps in `README.md` to assist future maintainers.
- [X] T015 Capture before/after screenshots of the social section and save them to `specs/001-x-brand-update/assets/x-icon-before-after.png` for PR evidence.
- [X] T016 Run final `bundle exec jekyll build` from project root `./` and confirm zero warnings ahead of review.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- Phase 1 must complete before any entry-point files reference the X asset.
- Phase 2 depends on Phase 1 and must complete before user story work begins.
- US1 (Phase 3) depends on Phase 2 and delivers the MVP slice.
- US2 (Phase 4) depends on US1 completion to avoid conflicting template edits.
- US3 (Phase 5) depends on US1 (for the link) but can run in parallel with US2 once Phase 2 finishes.
- Polish tasks run after all desired user stories finish.

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Run preview and accessibility validation together after template updates
Task: T006 [US1] Replace the Twitter entry in _includes/social.html
Task: T007 [US1] Ensure new tab behavior and visible label in _includes/social.html
Task: T008 [US1] Run bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts for validation
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1 (asset setup) and Phase 2 (configuration alignment).
2. Execute US1 tasks (T006‚ÄìT008) to ship a functional X link.
3. Stop and validate via local preview before merging if fast follow stories are deferred.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Foundation (Phases 1‚Äì2) ‚Üí US1 for MVP.
2. Ship US2 to polish branding consistency.
3. Ship US3 to finalize analytics guidance.
4. Run Polish phase to document and verify before release.

### Parallel Team Strategy

1. One contributor owns asset preparation (Phase 1) while another reviews configuration (Phase 2).
2. After Phase 2, US1 can proceed; US2 can start once US1 template changes merge; US3 can draft documentation concurrently with US2.
3. Coordinate on shared files (`_config.yml`, `_includes/social.html`) to avoid conflicts.

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] labels map tasks to specific user stories for traceability
- Each user story must remain independently previewable with `bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts`
- Capture build output and screenshots in PR to satisfy preview requirements
- Commit after each task or logical grouping with imperative subject lines
- Avoid vague tasks, shared file conflicts, or cross-story dependencies that break independence
